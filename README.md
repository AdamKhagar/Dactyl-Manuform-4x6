# Dactyl-Manuform-4x6
Ergonomic mechanical hotswappable keyboard with 5 thumb keys (50 keys).

In this project I used models from [ergohaven](https://github.com/ergohaven/dactyl-keyboard/releases/tag/stls) and did some changes in design.

## Who this keyboard for ? 

This keyboard is for people who use computer a lot and those who suffer from wrist pain caused by using usual keyboard and mouse. This keyboard is more healthy way to type.

Also I'm highly recomend to switch to vertival mices or trackball if want to get more ergonomics.

## Who this keyboard not for ?

This keyboard should not be your choice if want to play games becouse there is not enouth keys on this keyboard. You can try to play on other version of this keyboard which has 5 key rows.

# Requirements

1. Instruments:

    - First thing you need to build this keyboard is 3d printer.
    - Soldering iron and all other stuff coming with it.
    - Nippers, wire-cutter.
    - Twizzers.
    - Hex keys.
    
2. Materials:
   
    | Name | Number of pieces |
    | ---- | ------ |
    | Arduino Pro Micro/Elite C | 2 |
    | Switches ( I used gateron yellow switches ) | 50 |
    | Gateron Hotswap sockets | 50 |
    | 1N4148 diod | 50 |
    | M2.5 OD4mm brass insert nuts | 10 |
    | M2.5 6mm length screw bolts | 10 |
    | Wires | - |
    | Filament | - |
    | Single Row Male 2.54 Breakable Pin Header Connector | 200+ |
    
# How to build:

1. Print all parts. I do not recomend to use layer height more then 0.2 mm for main part and arduino holder. For lid and socket_bottom.stl you can increase layer height. To save time you can print socket_buttom without top and bottom with 30% infill. 
> **_Note_**: You going to need 50 items of socket_bottom. Use multiplayer in your slicer

2. Remove supports from your prints
